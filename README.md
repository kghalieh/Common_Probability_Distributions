# Common Probability Distributions

This project is to practise OOP in Python, in addition to building a python package, 
The goal is to create a useful package for data science including the following probability functions: 

* [TODO] Bernoulli Distribution
* [TODO] Uniform Distribution
* [Done] Binomial Distribution
* [Done] Normal Distribution
* [TODO] Poisson Distribution
* [TODO] Exponential Distribution

This project is based on a [UDACITY lesson](https://github.com/udacity/DSND_Term2/tree/master/lessons/ObjectOrientedProgramming/IdeFiles/4a_binomial_package)  where the starting code for Binomial Distribution
and Normal Distribution are provided and I had to complete it.
